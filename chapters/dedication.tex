\chapter{Dedication} %% Optional
The dedication is usually quite short, and is a personal rather than
an academic recognition.  The \emph{Dedication} does not have to be
titled, but it must appear in the table of contents.  If you want to
skip the chapter title but still enter it into the Table of Contents,
use this command \verb|\chapter[Dedication]{}|.

Note that this section is the last of the preliminary pages (with
lowercase Roman numeral page numbers).  It must be placed
\emph{before} the \verb|\mainmatter| command.  After that, Arabic
numbered pages will begin.
