\chapter{Landscape Mode}
The landscape mode allows you to rotate a page through 90 degrees.  It
is generally not a good idea to make the chapter heading landscape,
but it can be useful for long tables etc.

\begin{landscape}
  This text should appear rotated, allowing for formatting of very
  wide tables etc.  Note that this might only work after you convert
  the \texttt{dvi} file to a postscript (\texttt{ps}) or \texttt{pdf}
  file using \texttt{dvips} or \texttt{dvipdf} etc.  This feature is
  provided by the \verb|lscape| and the \verb|pdflscape| packages.
  The latter is preferred if it works as it also rotates the pages in
  the pdf file for easier viewing.
\end{landscape}
