\chapter{Preface} % Manditory if any of the conditions are met

You must include a preface if any part of your research was partly or
wholly published in articles, was part of a collaboration, or required
the approval of UBC Research Ethics Boards.

The Preface must include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A statement indicating the relative contributions of all
  collaborators and co-authors of publications (if any), emphasizing
  details of your contribution, and stating the proportion of research
  and writing conducted by you.
\item A list of any publications arising from work presented in the
  dissertation, and the chapter(s) in which the work is located.
\item The name of the particular UBC Research Ethics Board, and the
  Certificate Number(s) of the Ethics Certificate(s) obtained, if
  ethics approval was required for the research.
\end{itemize}

%%% Sections and subsections etc. in the Preface should in general
%%% not be listed in the table of contents, so use the starred form
%%% of \section etc.
\section*{Examples}
Chapter~\ref{cha:apple_ref} is based on work conducted in UBC's Maple
Syrup Laboratory by Dr. A.  Apple, Professor B. Boat, and Michael
McNeil Forbes. I was responsible for tapping the trees in forests X
and Z, conducted and supervised all boiling operations, and performed
frequent quality control tests on the product.

A version of chapter~\ref{cha:apple_ref} has been
published~\cite{Apple:2010}. I conducted all the testing and wrote
most of the manuscript. The section on ``Testing Implements'' was
originally drafted by Boat, B.  Check the first pages of this
chapter to see footnotes with similar information.

Note that this preface must come before the table of contents.  Note
also that this section ``Examples'' should not be listed in the table
of contents, so we have used the starred form: \verb|\section*{Example}|.
